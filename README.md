This is the 4th project in term1 for the **Self-Driving Car Engineer** Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://cn.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer--nd013)

The project used **deep neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks** to clone driving behavior.

The project implemented a model with architecture similar to **PilotNet** using **Keras**.   
The model output a steering angle to to an autonomous vehicle so that the vehicle could run on the track in simulator

The steps involved in this project are the following:

* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle can remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report
